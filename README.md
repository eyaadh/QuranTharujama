# QuranTharujama

This basically have been my patproject I had done as a part of challenging myself once I was done with Module 5 of [CWC+](https://learn.codewithchris.com/courses/foundations). Bascally this application is a complete collection of Quran Translation in both English and Dhivehi. The data were collection from [tanzil.net](https://tanzil.net/#trans/dv.divehi/1:1). And the recitations are from the repo [semarketir/quranjson](https://github.com/semarketir/quranjson).

Looking at the features within the application you shall be able to listen to recitation per verse, bookmark at a verse once you are done with the recitation for the day, so that you could revist the same verse later, search and filter on the Chapter list View. 

To run the project, simply clone the project and Open via XCode. The whole Build was done on XCode 13.3, MacOS Monterey and tested on 13 Pro Max.
